# Project-LLMnRAG
Comparison of training NLP Model with RAG 

## Project Idea:
The project involves conducting a comparative study between training a machine learning models and implementing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) models in the field of natural language processing (NLP). 

## Dataset:
I am planning to use the Pakistan Law dataset. It’s a pdf of 280 pages including all the clauses and rules. It’s a textual data of 280 pages. It’s a textual data, and it is openly available on the government website.
